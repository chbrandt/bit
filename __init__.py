"""
SLools is a library for scientific/astronomical image processing purposes.
By "scientific" I mean nothing but the fact that methods implemented here were 
designed to handle astronomical (sky) images, their filtering and segmentation.

This library is (still not well) distributed among image processing topics, like 
segmentation and filtering, and data-types particular methods (e.g, FITS files).
